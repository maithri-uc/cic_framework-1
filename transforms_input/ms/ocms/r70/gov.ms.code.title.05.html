<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“<b>Response<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“No. House Bill No.1 054 of the 2011 Regular Session, which is the subject of your request, is not an appropriation bill and is not subject to partial veto under Section 73 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“<b>Background<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“On April 26, 2011, the Governor returned House Bill No. 1054 to the House of Representatives with a partial veto message for Section 2 of the bill. House Bill No. 1054, which is generally known as the ‘transfer bill,’ is a bill that, among other things, provides for the transfer of state funds into certain accounts for use in the general fund appropriations process. The Governor said in his message that he was not concerned with the transfer components of the bill, but had concerns specifically with Section 2 of the bill.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“<b>Applicable Law and Discussion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Under the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 (hereinafter ‘Mississippi Constitution’), the powers of government are divided between and among three separate and distinct departments, to wit, the legislative department, the executive department and the judicial department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Miss. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 1 (1890). No person belonging to one department is authorized to exercise core powers belonging to another department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Miss. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 2 (1890);<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dye v. State ex rel. Hale, 507 So. 2d 332 at 343 (Miss. 1987); and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alexander v. State ex rel. Alain, 441 So. 2d 1329 (Miss. 1983).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The enactment of laws is an exercise of legislative power, which is subject to the executive power of veto. The Mississippi Constitution authorizes two types of vetoes, one which is applicable to all bills and is total in nature and another which is applicable only to appropriation bills and is partial in nature.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Section 721 authorizes the Governor to approve or disapprove, by way of veto, every bill that passes both houses of the Legislature:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Unless otherwise indicated all section numbers refer to sections of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Every Bill which shall pass both Houses shall be presented to the Governor of the state. If he approve, he shall sign it; but if he does not approve, he shall return it, with his objections, to the House in which it originated, which shall enter the objections at large upon its Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds (2/3) of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, with the objections, to the other House, by which, likewise, it shall be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds (2/3) of that House, it shall become a law; but in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the Governor within five (5) days (Sundays excepted) after it has been presented to him, it shall become a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Legislature, by adjournment, prevented its return, in which case such Bill shall be a law unless the Governor shall veto it within fifteen (15) days (Sundays excepted) after it is presented to him, and such Bill shall be returned to the Legislature, with his objections, within three (3) days after the beginning of the next session of the Legislature.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“In exercising the gubernatorial veto under Section 72, the Governor must veto the entire bill. There is no power to approve parts of a bill, while disapproving other parts.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“It is the opinion of this office that House Bill No. 1054 of the 2011 Regular Session is not an appropriation bill and, therefore, is not subject to partial veto under Section 73.”</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“In contrast, Section 73 authorizes the Governor to veto parts and approve parts of any ‘appropriation bill’:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The governor may veto parts of any appropriation bill, and approve parts of the same, and the portions approved shall be law.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The power to approve parts of a bill, while vetoing or disapproving other parts of the same bill, is expressly limited to appropriation bills and may not be exercised with regard to other legislation. An attempt to partially veto any bill other than an appropriation bill would be outside the authority granted to the Governor under the Mississippi Constitution and would be an impermissible infringement of the powers of the Legislature.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“ The Mississippi Supreme Court in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Fordice v. Bryan,</i> 651 So. 2d 998 (Miss. 1995), a case involving the exercise of a partial veto, stated:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Article IV, Section 73 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 states: ‘The governor may veto<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>parts</i> of any<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>appropriation bill</i>, and approve parts of the same, and the portions approved shall be law.’<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Miss. Const. art. IV, Section 73 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Governor is entitled to exercise his Section 73 veto power upon ‘parts’ of ‘appropriation’ bills, and only upon ‘parts’ of ‘appropriation’ bills. The Governor may not exercise the Section 73 partial veto power on revenue raising bond bills.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“In order for the bills to be susceptible to the Governor’s Section 73 partial veto power, they must fix a definite maximum amount, Section 63, and not continue to be in force withdrawing money from the state treasury longer than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year ending after the meeting of the legislature at its next regular session, Section<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>64. 651 So. 2d 998, 1000.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Although there is no definition of ‘appropriation bill’ in the Mississippi Constitution, there are mandatory requirements for appropriation bills contained therein. Section 63, which requires an appropriation bill to state the maximum sum authorized to be drawn from the State Treasury, states:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“No appropriation bill shall be passed by the legislature which does not fix definitely the maximum sum thereby authorized to be drawn from the treasury.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Section 64, which provides that bills making appropriations out of the State Treasury only be in force no more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year, states:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“No bill passed after the adoption of this Constitution to make appropriations of money out of the state treasury shall continue in force more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year ending after the meeting of the legislature at its next regular session; nor shall such bill be passed except by the votes of a majority of all members elected to each house of the legislature.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Section 69 prescribes the contents of appropriation bills and prohibits the engrafting of other legislation therein and reads as follows:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“General appropriation bills shall contain only the appropriations to defray the ordinary expenses of the executive, legislative, and judicial departments of the government; to pay interest on state bonds, and to support the common schools. All other appropriations shall be made by separate bills, each embracing but one subject. Legislation shall not be engrafted on the appropriation bills, but the same may prescribe the conditions on which the money may be drawn, and for what purposes paid.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Section 68 provides that appropriation bills (and revenue bills) have precedence in the Legislature over all other business:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Appropriation and revenue bills shall, at regular sessions of the legislature, have precedence in both houses over all other business, and no such bills shall be passed during the last five days of the session.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Under the Joint Rules of the Senate and the House, appropriation bills and revenue bills are subject to deadlines during the legislative session which are different from other bills. See Joint Rule 40 (2011).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“In accordance with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Fordice v. Bryan, supra</i>, the validity of a partial veto under Section 73 depends on the nature of the bill itself, i.e., is House Bill No. 1054 an appropriation bill subject to partial veto under Section 73 or is it a general bill subject only to the general veto provisions of Section 72? If House Bill No. 1054 is not an appropriation bill, then it is not subject to partial veto under Section 73.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“To determine whether House Bill No. 1054 is an appropriation bill, it is necessary (1) to examine and compare its provisions with the constitutional sections which prescribe the mandatory provisions of an appropriations bill and (2) to examine the legislative process in which House Bill No. 1054 came to be enacted, i.e., was House Bill No. 1054 handled procedurally as an appropriation bill?</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“House Bill No. 1054 contains no maximum amount which may be withdrawn from the Treasury as required by Section 63. House Bill No.1054 is not limited in duration to no more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year as required by Section 64. Its contents are not limited to appropriations defraying the expenses of State government, paying interest on state bonds, and supporting the common schools as required by Section 69.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“In addition to not satisfying the constitutional requirements of appropriation bills, House Bill No. 1054 contains provisions commonly seen in general bills. For example, House Bill No. 1054<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>inter alia </i>authorizes a half dozen transfers of funds making it similar to ‘transfer bills’ in previous legislative sessions, which were also treated procedurally by the Legislature as general bills. House Bill No. 1059, 2010 Regular Session and House Bill No. 1505, 2009 Regular Session. In addition, House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the borrowing of special funds to offset any temporary cash flow deficiency in the Health Care Expendable Fund. It provides that certain funds held for veterans by the State Veterans Home shall be considered to be held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the veterans. House Bill No. 1054 also revises the time limit in which a resident of the coastal counties, whose residence was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, must begin construction in order to not be required to meet current lot size requirements. These provisions are all similar in nature to other provisions commonly found in general bills.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054, which was the subject of the Governor’s veto message, reads as follows:</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“On or before July 1 of each fiscal year, or at such other times as necessary, the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate (‘the Legislature’) shall submit a request to the State Fiscal Officer for the funds necessary to pay (a) the expenses of the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation, (b) the state’s share of various assessments from legislative-related organizations, and (c) any other legislative-related expenses. The State Fiscal Officer shall transfer to the Legislature the amount or amounts as requested by the Legislature from the Secretary of State’s Fund No. 3111. The State Fiscal Officer shall transfer such obligated funds in a timely manner as determined by the Legislature. The Legislature is authorized to escalate the appropriate budgets during the fiscal year by the respective amounts transferred and to expend those sums for the purposes authorized by law.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Briefly stated, Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the transfer of funds from the Secretary of State’s Fund No. 31112, the escalation of the Legislature’s budget by amounts transferred from Fund No. 31112, and the payment of legislative expenses specified therein.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fund No. 3111 contains special funds which are generated by fees earned by the Secretary of State and the Legislature appropriates funds therefrom for some of the operations of the Secretary of State’s office.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“While Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the expenditure of public funds, it does not do so within the framework of an appropriation bill. Appropriation bills are not the exclusive legislative vehicle for authorizing the expenditure of public funds. As you note in your letter of request, the Department of Finance and Administration is authorized by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Section 7-1-255 of the Mississippi Code, a general law provision, to escalate its budget based on application fees it receives. Similarly, the Department of Audit is authorized by<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Section 7-7-81 (2) of the Mississippi Code, another general law provision, to escalate its budget based on funds deposited in the ‘Auditor’s Enhanced Accountability Fund.’ Upon each agency’s respective budget being escalated, these Code sections authorize the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Audit to expend available funds. No further action of the Legislature is necessary. You list thirteen other examples of escalation and expenditure authority by general laws in your letter.3</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>See Sections 17-17-63(3), 21-35-31 (2), 27-19-44.2(2), 27-19-179(2), 27-103-303(4), 31-913,33- 15-311(2),37-151-25,45-39-5(4), 57-1-303(1)(a), 57-75-15(4)(b)-(m), 57-75-15(18)(b), and 69-46-7(1) and (2) of the Mississippi Code.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“In addition, bond bills, specifically found not to be appropriation bills in<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Fordice v. Bryan, </i>supra, and, therefore, not subject to partial veto, typically authorize the expenditure of public funds after bonds are issued without any further act of the Legislature. Similarly, legislation establishing revolving funds, though not appropriation bills, generally authorize the expenditure of public funds without any further act of the Legislature.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The provisions in Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054 are similar to the general law escalation provisions mentioned above and the thirteen other general law examples referenced in your letter. Once the transfer of funds is made from Fund No. 3111 and the Legislature’s budget is escalated, the Legislature is authorized to make expenditures from available funds.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“With regard to its procedural treatment by the Legislature, House Bill No. 1054 was not afforded the precedence and deadlines applicable to appropriation bills. Instead, House Bill No. 1054 was subject to the deadlines applicable to general bills. The ‘transfer bills’ in previous legislative sessions, referred to above, were also treated procedurally by the Legislature as general bills.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“All of the comparisons of the constitutional requirements for appropriation bills with the contents of House Bill No. 1054 and the legislative procedure employed for enactment indicate that House Bill No. 1054 is a general bill, not an appropriation bill. The Governor, in his veto message, acknowledged that House Bill No. 1054 is a general bill. However, he characterizes House Bill No. 1054 as a general bill which contains an appropriation in Section 2 and, therefore, is subject to a partial veto.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“We are unable to find any authority for the proposition that any bill which authorizes the expenditure of public funds is an appropriation bill for purposes of Section 73. On the contrary, it is clear under<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Fordice v. Bryan, supra</i>, that a bill must meet the constitutional requirements set forth for appropriation bills in order to be subject to partial veto under Section 73. While the Governor was authorized to exercise his general veto authority under Section 72 with regard to House Bill No. 1054, he was not authorized to exercise his partial veto authority under Section 73. An unconstitutional attempt of a partial veto is a nullity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>See<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fordice v. Bryan, supra, and State v.
