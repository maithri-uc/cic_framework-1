<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“WHEREAS, Senate Bill No. 2144, Laws of 1970, appropriated the sum of Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand ($250,000.00) for the purpose of making progress payments on such Code printing contract for the fiscal year 1971, beginning July 1, 1970 and ending June 30, 1971; Senate Bill No. 1778, Laws of 1971, appropriated the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) for the purpose of making additional progress payments on the Code printing contract for the fiscal year 1972, ending June 30, 1972; and</p>

<p class="p6"><b>(1)</b> There is created the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation, which is hereinafter referred to as the “joint committee.” The joint committee shall be composed of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Mississippi, the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of the Mississippi State Senate, the Chairman of the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, four (4) members of the House of Representatives to be named by the Speaker of the House, and four (4) members of the Senate to be named by the Lieutenant Governor. If any ex officio member of the joint committee holds two (2) positions entitling him to membership on the committee, the Speaker of the House or the Lieutenant Governor, as the case may be, shall appoint another member of the respective house to membership on the committee. The chairmanship of the committee shall alternate for twelve-month periods, beginning on May 1 of each year, between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Lieutenant Governor, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives serving as the first chairman. In the absence of the Chairman of the House Rules Committee or of the Senate Rules Committee, the vice chairman of that committee shall be entitled to attend; if the vice chairman is unable to attend or if an appointed member is unable to attend, another legislator may be designated to attend by the Speaker of the House or the Lieutenant Governor, as the case may be. If the Speaker of the House or the Lieutenant Governor is unable to attend a meeting, he may designate a legislator to substitute for him at that meeting. Any person serving as such a designated proxy shall have a vote at the meeting he was selected to attend and also when attending, shall receive compensation and expenses in the same manner and amount as regular members of the joint committee.</p>
<p class="p6">There shall be no business transacted, including adoption of rules of procedure, without the presence of a quorum of the joint committee. A quorum shall be eight (8) members, to consist of four (4) members from the House of Representatives and four (4) members from the Senate. No action shall be valid unless approved by the majority of those members present and voting, entered upon the minutes of the joint committee and signed by the chairman and vice chairman.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(2)</b> In addition to their legislative salaries as provided by law, the members of the committee shall receive per diem as authorized by law for their services in carrying out the duties of the committee and, in addition thereto, shall receive a daily expense allowance equal to the maximum daily expense rate allowable to employees of the federal government for travel in the high rate geographical area of Jackson, Mississippi, as may be established by federal regulations, including mileage as authorized by Section 25-3-41. However, in no case shall the members of the committee draw per diem while the Legislature is in regular or special session, except that members may receive the per diem and expenses authorized by this section when the Legislature is in session but in recess under the terms of a concurrent resolution, or in recess during a special session.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(3)</b> The committee shall meet at least one (1) time during the interim that the Legislature is not in regular session, and the chairman may call additional meetings at such times as he deems necessary or advisable.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(4)</b> All expenses incurred by and on behalf of the committee shall be paid from funds appropriated therefor, or from a sum to be provided in equal portion from the contingency funds of the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>(5)</b> Upon the request of the joint committee, the Attorney General shall provide legal assistance or legal representation to the committee on any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee, including bringing suits on behalf of the committee and representing the committee in any suits brought against the committee.</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“<b>Response<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“No. House Bill No.1054 of the 2011 Regular Session, which is the subject of your request, is not an appropriation bill and is not subject to partial veto under Section 73 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“<b>Background<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“On April 26, 2011, the Governor returned House Bill No. 1054 to the House of Representatives with a partial veto message for Section 2 of the bill. House Bill No. 1054, which is generally known as the ‘transfer bill,’ is a bill that, among other things, provides for the transfer of state funds into certain accounts for use in the general fund appropriations process. The Governor said in his message that he was not concerned with the transfer components of the bill, but had concerns specifically with Section 2 of the bill.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“<b>Applicable Law and Discussion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Under the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 (hereinafter ‘Mississippi Constitution’), the powers of government are divided between and among three separate and distinct departments, to wit, the legislative department, the executive department and the judicial department. Miss. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 1 (1890). No person belonging to one department is authorized to exercise core powers belonging to another department. Miss. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 2 (1890); Dye v. State ex rel. Hale, 507 So. 2d 332 at 343 (Miss. 1987); and Alexander v. State ex rel. Alain, 441 So. 2d 1329 (Miss. 1983).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“The enactment of laws is an exercise of legislative power, which is subject to the executive power of veto. The Mississippi Constitution authorizes two types of vetoes, one which is applicable to all bills and is total in nature and another which is applicable only to appropriation bills and is partial in nature.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Section 72 authorizes the Governor to approve or disapprove, by way of veto, every bill that passes both houses of the Legislature: 1<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless otherwise indicated all section numbers refer to sections of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890. “Every Bill which shall pass both Houses shall be presented to the Governor of the state. If he approve, he shall sign it; but if he does not approve, he shall return it, with his objections, to the House in which it originated, which shall enter the objections at large upon its Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds (2/3) of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, with the objections, to the other House, by which, likewise, it shall be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds (2/3) of that House, it shall become a law; but in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the Governor within five (5) days (Sundays excepted) after it has been presented to him, it shall become a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Legislature, by adjournment, prevented its return, in which case such Bill shall be a law unless the Governor shall veto it within fifteen (15) days (Sundays excepted) after it is presented to him, and such Bill shall be returned to the Legislature, with his objections, within three (3) days after the beginning of the next session of the Legislature. “In exercising the gubernatorial veto under Section 72, the Governor must veto the entire bill. There is no power to approve parts of a bill, while disapproving other parts. “In contrast, Section 73 authorizes the Governor to veto parts and approve parts of any ‘appropriation bill’: “The governor may veto parts of any appropriation bill, and approve parts of the same, and the portions approved shall be law. “The power to approve parts of a bill, while vetoing or disapproving other parts of the same bill, is expressly limited to appropriation bills and may not be exercised with regard to other legislation. An attempt to partially veto any bill other than an appropriation bill would be outside the authority granted to the Governor under the Mississippi Constitution and would be an impermissible infringement of the powers of the Legislature. “ , a case involving the exercise of a partial veto, stated: The Mississippi Supreme Court in 651 So. 2d 998 (Miss. 1995) Fordice v. Bryan, “Article IV, Section 73 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 states: ‘The governor may veto<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of any , and approve parts of the same, and the portions approved shall be law.’ (emphasis added). Therefore, the Governor is entitled to exercise his Section 73 veto power upon ‘parts’ of ‘appropriation’ bills, and only upon ‘parts’ of ‘appropriation’ bills. The Governor may not exercise the Section 73 partial veto power on revenue raising bond bills. parts appropriation bill Miss. Const. art. IV, Section 73 “In order for the bills to be susceptible to the Governor’s Section 73 partial veto power, they must fix a definite maximum amount, Section 63, and not continue to be in force withdrawing money from the state treasury longer than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year ending after the meeting of the legislature at its next regular session, Section . 64. 651 So. 2d 998, 1000 “Although there is no definition of ‘appropriation bill’ in the Mississippi Constitution, there are mandatory requirements for appropriation bills contained therein. Section 63, which requires an appropriation bill to state the maximum sum authorized to be drawn from the State Treasury, states: “No appropriation bill shall be passed by the legislature which does not fix definitely the maximum sum thereby authorized to be drawn from the treasury. “Section 64, which provides that bills making appropriations out of the State Treasury only be in force no more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year, states: “No bill passed after the adoption of this Constitution to make appropriations of money out of the state treasury shall continue in force more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year ending after the meeting of the legislature at its next regular session; nor shall such bill be passed except by the votes of a majority of all members elected to each house of the legislature. “Section 69 prescribes the contents of appropriation bills and prohibits the engrafting of other legislation therein and reads as follows: “General appropriation bills shall contain only the appropriations to defray the ordinary expenses of the executive, legislative, and judicial departments of the government; to pay interest on state bonds, and to support the common schools. All other appropriations shall be made by separate bills, each embracing but one subject. Legislation shall not be engrafted on the appropriation bills, but the same may prescribe the conditions on which the money may be drawn, and for what purposes paid. “Section 68 provides that appropriation bills (and revenue bills) have precedence in the Legislature over all other business: “Appropriation and revenue bills shall, at regular sessions of the legislature, have precedence in both houses over all other business, and no such bills shall be passed during the last five days of the session. “Under the Joint Rules of the Senate and the House, appropriation bills and revenue bills are subject to deadlines during the legislative session which are different from other bills. See Joint Rule 40 (2011). “In accordance with , the validity of a partial veto under Section 73 depends on the nature of the bill itself, i.e., is House Bill No.1054 an appropriation bill subject to partial veto under Section 73 or is it a general bill subject only to the general veto provisions of Section 72? If House Bill No. 1054 is not an appropriation bill, then it is not subject to partial veto under Section 73. Fordice v. Bryan, supra “To determine whether House Bill No. 1054 is an appropriation bill, it is necessary (1) to examine and compare its provisions with the constitutional sections which prescribe the mandatory provisions of an appropriations bill and (2) to examine the legislative process in which House Bill No. 1054 came to be enacted, i.e., was House Bill No. 1054 handled procedurally as an appropriation bill? “House Bill No.1054 contains no maximum amount which may be withdrawn from the Treasury as required by Section 63. House Bill No.1054 is not limited in duration to no more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year as required by Section 64. Its contents are not limited to appropriations defraying the expenses of State government, paying interest on state bonds, and supporting the common schools as required by Section 69. “In addition to not satisfying the constitutional requirements of appropriation bills, House Bill No.1054 contains provisions commonly seen in general bills. For example, House Bill No.1054 authorizes a half dozen transfers of funds making it similar to ‘transfer bills’ in previous legislative sessions, which were also treated procedurally by the Legislature as general bills. House Bill No.1059, 2010 Regular Session and House Bill No. 1505, 2009 Regular Session. In addition, House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the borrowing of special funds to offset any temporary cash flow deficiency in the Health Care Expendable Fund. It provides that certain funds held for veterans by the State Veterans Home shall be considered to be held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the veterans. House Bill No.1054 also revises the time limit in which a resident of the coastal counties, whose residence was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, must begin construction in order to not be required to meet current lot size requirements. These provisions are all similar in nature to other provisions commonly found in general bills. inter alia “Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054, which was the subject of the Governor’s veto message, reads as follows: “On or before July 1 of each fiscal year, or at such other times as necessary, the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate (‘the Legislature’) shall submit a request to the State Fiscal Officer for the funds necessary to pay (a) the expenses of the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation, (b) the state’s share of various assessments from legislative-related organizations, and (c) any other legislative-related expenses. The State Fiscal Officer shall transfer to the Legislature the amount or amounts as requested by the Legislature from the Secretary of State’s Fund No. 3111. The State Fiscal Officer shall transfer such obligated funds in a timely manner as determined by the Legislature. The Legislature is authorized to escalate the appropriate budgets during the fiscal year by the respective amounts transferred and to expend those sums for the purposes authorized by law. “Briefly stated, Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the transfer of funds from the Secretary of State’s Fund No. 3111, the escalation of the Legislature’s budget by amounts transferred from Fund No. 3111, and the payment of legislative expenses specified therein.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fund No. 3111 contains special funds which are generated by fees earned by the Secretary of State and the Legislature appropriates funds therefrom for some of the operations of the Secretary of State’s office. “While Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the expenditure of public funds, it does not do so within the framework of an appropriation bill. Appropriation bills are not the exclusive legislative vehicle for authorizing the expenditure of public funds. As you note in your letter of request, the Department of Finance and Administration is authorized by , a general law provision, to escalate its budget based on application fees it receives. Similarly, the Department of Audit is authorized by , another general law provision, to escalate its budget based on funds deposited in the ‘Auditor’s Enhanced Accountability Fund.’ Upon each agency’s respective budget being escalated, these Code sections authorize the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Audit to expend available funds. No further action of the Legislature is necessary. You list thirteen other examples of escalation and expenditure authority by general laws in your letter. Section 7-1-255 of the Mississippi Code Section 7-7-81 (2) of the Mississippi Code<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See , , , , , 31-913,33- 15-311(2),37-151-25,45-39-5(4), 57-1-303(1)(a), 57-75-15(4)(b)-(m), 57-75-15(18)(b), and 69-46-7(1) and (2) of the Mississippi Code. Sections 17-17-63(3) 21-35-31 (2) 27-19-44.2(2) 27-19-179(2) 27-103-303(4) “In addition, bond bills, specifically found not to be appropriation bills in , and, therefore, not subject to partial veto, typically authorize the expenditure of public funds after bonds are issued without any further act of the Legislature. Similarly, legislation establishing revolving funds, though not appropriation bills, generally authorize the expenditure of public funds without any further act of the Legislature. supra Fordice v. Bryan, “The provisions in Section 2 of House Bill No.1054 are similar to the general law escalation provisions mentioned above and the thirteen other general law examples referenced in your letter. Once the transfer of funds is made from Fund No. 3111 and the Legislature’s budget is escalated, the Legislature is authorized to make expenditures from available funds. “With regard to its procedural treatment by the Legislature, House Bill No.1054 was not afforded the precedence and deadlines applicable to appropriation bills. Instead, House Bill No. 1054 was subject to the deadlines applicable to general bills. The ‘transfer bills’ in previous legislative sessions, referred to above, were also treated procedurally by the Legislature as general bills. “All of the comparisons of the constitutional requirements for appropriation bills with the contents of House Bill No. 1054 and the legislative procedure employed for enactment indicate that House Bill No. 1054 is a general bill, not an appropriation bill. The Governor, in his veto message, acknowledged that House Bill No. 1054 is a general bill. However, he characterizes House Bill No. 1054 as a general bill which contains an appropriation in Section 2 and, therefore, is subject to a partial veto. “We are unable to find any authority for the proposition that any bill which authorizes the expenditure of public funds is an appropriation bill for purposes of Section 73. On the contrary, it is clear under , that a bill must meet the constitutional requirements set forth for appropriation bills in order to be subject to partial veto under Section 73. While the Governor was authorized to exercise his general veto authority under Section 72 with regard to House Bill No.1054, he was not authorized to exercise his partial veto authority under Section 73. An unconstitutional attempt of a partial veto is a nullity. . Fordice v. Bryan, supra See , and Fordice v. Bryan, supra , 76 Miss. 158, 23 So. 643 (1898) State v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial judge’s two comments that defendant’s case was a “capital case” did not taint the jury because “capital case” included crimes punishable by life imprisonment, Miss Code Ann. § 1-3-4, and defendant was indicted on two counts of statutory rape, a crime for which life imprisonment was possible, Miss. Code Ann. § 97-3-65(2)(c); the trial judge never said defendant’s case was a capital-murder case or a death-penalty case. Harrison v. State, 49 So.3d 80, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 635 (Miss. 2010).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 13-5-73, jurors in a capital case should be sworn to well and truly try the issue between the state and the prisoner, and a true verdict should be given according to the evidence and law, and because the crime of forcible rape was a capital crime under Miss. Code Ann. § 97-3-65(4)(a), defendant was entitled to have the capital oath administered to the jurors, but the trial judge failed to administer that oath; however, the capital oath given in the middle of the trial, together with the petit oath given at the beginning of defendant’s trial, which were substantially the same, were sufficient to instruct the jury of their duty. Golden v. State, 968 So. 2d 378, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 530 (Miss. 2007), cert. dismissed, 977 So. 2d 343, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 111 (Miss. 2008).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Defendant contended that the indictment failed to charge all of the elements necessary to impose the death penalty under Mississippi law, but his argument failed because (1) pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 99-19-101(7), a jury only needed to find that defendant killed, and did not need a true mens rea; (2) under Miss. Code Ann. § 99-19-101(5), aggravating circumstances existed; and (3) there was no increase in the maximum penalty because the maximum penalty for killing while engaged in the commission of sexual battery was death as the crime was defined as capital murder under Miss. Code Ann. § 97-3-19(2)(e), and, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 1-3-4, a capital murder was a crime punishable by death. Havard v. State, 928 So. 2d 771, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1119, 127 S. Ct. 931, 166 L. Ed. 2d 716, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 153 (U.S. 2007).</p>

Code Ann. § 47-7-17 as the inmate’s life sentence for armed robbery meant that he had been convicted of a capital offense, the inmate was not deprived of his due process rights because of the lack of hearing as the argument had not been raised in the lower court, and the inmate was not prejudiced by the lack of publication. Way v. Miller, 919 So. 2d 1036, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 471 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant twelve peremptory challenges because robbery was a noncapital offense as provided in Miss. Code Ann. § 1-3-4 and Miss. Code Ann. § 97-3-73, therefore, Miss. Code Ann. § 99-17-3 and Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. R. 10.01, the statutory and rules provisions which provide extra peremptory challenges to the venire in capital cases, were inapplicable. The jury was required to determine defendant’s guilt on the principal offense and not to consider the prior convictions which brought into consideration his life sentence under the habitual offender statute, Miss. Code Ann. § 99-19-83(3). Jones v. State, 902 So. 2d 593, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1011 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 901 So. 2d 1273, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 2005).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fact that 3 defendants were jointly tried did not operate to increase number of peremptory challenges; defendants charged with murder were entitled to 12 peremptory challenges because this was capital case, and received more than statutorily mandated number when trial court increased number of challenges for each side to 15, upon denying defendants’ motion for 36 challenges. Johnson v. State, 512 So. 2d 1246, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2703 (Miss.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 968, 108 S. Ct. 462, 98 L. Ed. 2d 402, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 4990 (U.S. 1987), overruled in part, Smith v.

<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>All existing statutory procedural safeguards involving so-called “capital” crimes or offenses or “crimes of a serious nature” would still be in full force and effect, even though the death penalty had been removed from some of those offenses; in enacting this section, the legislature intended to retain these safeguards in all cases where the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. Wilburn v. State, 356 So. 2d 1173, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2476 (Miss. 1978).</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This section does not amend the constitutional definition of “capital offenses” (Article III § 29 Miss Const. of 1890) which includes only offenses for which the death penalty is permitted.

Additionally, it could hardly have been stated that capital rape was a false statement since defendant’s maximum possible punishment for a violation of Miss. Code Ann. § 97-3-65(1)(b) was imprisonment for life. Gordon v. State, 977 So. 2d 420, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 169 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).</p>
